# WaterPumpAutomation
This is an Arduino project to automate the filling of water tank. I made this all by my self during 2020-21.
The code and circuit diagram of the project are in the repository.

Features -

--> A 16x2 LCD is used to display the status of the pump and the water level in the tank.

--> It reads the water level using an ultrasonic sensor which is to be put right below the cap of the tank.

--> The pump can also be turned on manually.

--> A photoresistor is put near the light, which is switched on when the generator is turned on, so that the pump is not switched on while the generator is on.
